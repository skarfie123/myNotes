Rabbit MQ Best Practices
- short queues -> lower ram, faster recovery
- lazy queues -> predictable performance, minimises ram but slower throughput
- dont use lazy queues if queues always short or need very high performance
- multicore - more than one queue
- split queues into different cores
-- consistent hash exchange plugin
-- rabbitmq sharding
- autodelete unused queues
